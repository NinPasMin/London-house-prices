### Project Overview

This project explores the economic and housing trends in London and the UK, highlighting disparities in salaries, property prices, and growth rates across different areas. It examines how central boroughs like Westminster and the City of London dominate in earnings and property prices, while outer boroughs remain more affordable but experience slower growth. The analysis also identifies trends in property types, growth volatility, and investment potential within London's dynamic real estate market.
